## Educational Game Code Review Standards

### Child Safety Review Checklist

**Data Privacy Compliance**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Only collect learning-relevant data
const learningData = {
  problem_attempted: "7 × 8",
  answer_given: 56,
  is_correct: true,
  response_time: 3.2
};

// ❌ Bad: Collecting unnecessary personal data
const userData = {
  full_name: "Sarah Johnson",  // Too much personal info
  email: "parent@email.com",   // Not needed for learning
  location: "123 Main St"      // Inappropriate for children
};
```

**Error Handling for Children**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Child-friendly error messages
function handleMathError(error) {
  showChildMessage("Oops! Let's try that again. You're doing great!");
  logTechnicalError(error); // Log for developers, not shown to child
}

// ❌ Bad: Technical or scary error messages
function handleError(error) {
  alert("FATAL ERROR: " + error.stack); // Frightening for children
  throw error; // Could crash and lose progress
}
```

**Safe Data Storage**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Local storage with encryption
const saveProgress = (childData) => {
  const encryptedData = encrypt(childData);
  localStorage.setItem('learning_progress', encryptedData);
};

// ❌ Bad: Unprotected data or external storage
const saveProgress = (childData) => {
  sendToAnalytics(childData); // External data sharing without consent
  localStorage.setItem('data', JSON.stringify(childData)); // Unencrypted
};
```

### Educational Architecture Review

**Problem Generation Quality**:
```python
# ✅ Good: Age-appropriate problem generation
def generate_multiplication_problem(max_number=12):
    factor1 = random.randint(1, max_number)
    factor2 = random.randint(1, max_number)
    
    return {
        'problem': f"{factor1} × {factor2} = ?",
        'answer': factor1 * factor2,
        'difficulty_level': assess_difficulty(factor1, factor2)
    }

# ❌ Bad: Problems beyond age level
def generate_problem():
    factor1 = random.randint(1, 999)  # Too large for 8-year-olds
    factor2 = random.randint(-50, 50)  # Negative numbers inappropriate
    return factor1 * factor2
```

**Progress Tracking Accuracy**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Accurate learning analytics
const updateMasteryProgress = (fact, isCorrect, responseTime) => {
  const factData = getFactData(fact);
  factData.attempts++;
  
  if (isCorrect) {
    factData.correct_answers++;
    factData.recent_performance.push({ correct: true, time: responseTime });
  }
  
  factData.mastery_level = calculateMastery(factData);
  saveLearningProgress(factData);
};

// ❌ Bad: Inaccurate or missing progress tracking
const updateProgress = (isCorrect) => {
  if (isCorrect) score++; // Doesn't track which facts or learning
  // Missing: Which math fact, response time, learning patterns
};
```

**Reward System Integrity**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Tied to genuine learning achievement
const checkRewardEligibility = (sessionData) => {
  const correctAnswers = sessionData.problems.filter(p => p.correct).length;
  const minimumAccuracy = sessionData.accuracy >= 70; // Learning zone
  const genuineEffort = sessionData.duration >= 300; // At least 5 minutes
  
  return correctAnswers >= 10 && minimumAccuracy && genuineEffort;
};

// ❌ Bad: Rewards not tied to learning
const giveReward = () => {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) return true; // Random rewards don't motivate learning
};
```

### Performance Review for Children

**Responsive Interactions**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Immediate feedback for children
const handleAnswerSubmit = async (answer) => {
  // Show immediate visual feedback
  showProcessingIndicator();
  
  // Process quickly (under 200ms target)
  const result = await validateAnswer(answer);
  
  // Clear, immediate response
  showAnswerFeedback(result.isCorrect);
  updateProgressBar(result.progress);
};

// ❌ Bad: Slow or unclear feedback
const processAnswer = (answer) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Long delay frustrates children
    let result = complexCalculation(answer);
    console.log(result); // Feedback not visible to child
  }, 2000);
};
```

**Memory and Resource Management**:
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Efficient resource usage
const cleanupGameSession = () => {
  // Clean up audio resources
  backgroundMusic?.pause();
  backgroundMusic = null;
  
  // Clear large data structures
  previousProblems.clear();
  animationFrames.forEach(frame => cancelAnimationFrame(frame));
};

// ❌ Bad: Resource leaks that slow down app
const endGame = () => {
  // Missing cleanup - audio keeps playing, memory grows
  // App gets slower with each game session
};
```

## Code Review Comment Templates

### Child Safety Issues
```markdown
**🔒 Child Safety Concern**: [File: `src/auth/data-handler.js:45`]

**Issue**: This code collects the child's full name and stores it unencrypted.

**Child Safety Risk**: Violates COPPA requirements for minimal data collection and puts child privacy at risk.

**Recommendation**: 
- Store only a first name or nickname
- Encrypt all stored child data
- Review data collection against educational necessity

**Code Suggestion**:
```javascript
// Instead of full name, use nickname only
const childProfile = {
  nickname: childName.split(' ')[0], // First name only
  learningProgress: encrypt(progressData)
};
```

### Educational Effectiveness Issues
```markdown
**📚 Educational Design Concern**: [File: `src/game/problem-generator.py:28`]

**Issue**: Problem difficulty jumps from 2× tables directly to 9× tables without progression.

**Learning Impact**: This violates learning science principles and will frustrate children.

**Recommendation**: Implement gradual difficulty progression based on educational research:
1. Start with pattern facts (2×, 5×, 10×)
2. Progress to building facts (3×, 4×, 6×)
3. End with memorization facts (7×, 8×, 9×)

**Reference**: Educational Content Agent guidelines, section "Multiplication Fact Progression"
```

### Performance Issues
```markdown
**⚡ Performance Issue**: [File: `src/ui/game-screen.js:156`]

**Issue**: Animation calculations happen on every frame without optimization.

**Child Experience Impact**: Causes lag during gameplay, frustrating for 8-year-old attention spans.

**Recommendation**: 
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Cache calculation results
- Limit animation complexity for target hardware

**Code Suggestion**:
```javascript
// Optimize animation performance
const animateProgress = (targetPercent) => {
  const animate = (timestamp) => {
    // Optimized animation logic here
    if (currentPercent < targetPercent) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
  };
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
};
```

### Architecture Adherence
```markdown
**🏗️ Architecture Deviation**: [File: `src/backend/progress-tracker.py:67`]

**Issue**: Direct database writes bypass the established data layer pattern.

**Technical Risk**: Makes code harder to maintain and test, breaks established patterns.

**Educational Game Context**: Progress tracking is critical for learning analytics - needs to be reliable.

**Recommendation**: Use the established `DataManager` class for all progress updates to maintain consistency and enable proper testing.
```
