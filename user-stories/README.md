# Squishmallow Collector - Development Phases

This directory contains user stories organized by development phases. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Setup](./phase-1-foundation.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Electron project setup and basic dashboard |
| [Phase 2: Core Game Logic](./phase-2-core-game.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Math problem generation and validation |
| [Phase 3: Game Flow & Progress](./phase-3-game-flow.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Progress tracking and 3-strikes system |
| [Phase 4: Squishmallow Collection](./phase-4-collection.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Collection system and data persistence |

| [Phase 6: Polish & Enhancement](./phase-6-polish.md) | ‚è≥ Not Started | Visual styling, sounds, and animations |

## How to Use These Files

1. **Work through phases sequentially** - Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Check off acceptance criteria** as you complete them
3. **Update phase status** when completed: ‚è≥ Not Started ‚Üí üîÑ In Progress ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete
4. **Test thoroughly** at the end of each phase before moving to the next

## Development Approach

- **Small, testable increments** - Each story should result in visible progress
- **Run and test frequently** - Verify the app works after each major change
- **Focus on functionality first** - Polish comes in the final phase
- **Keep it simple** - Aim for MVP features that can be enhanced later
